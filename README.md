# QOL mod for Scrapmechanic
Updated for release 0.4.6

## Installation

Copy the contents in the Install folder into the Scrap Mechanic main 
directory and overwrite when prompted.
Default directory location : `\Steam\steamapps\common\Scrap Mechanic`

Alternatively, you can right click on scrap mechanic in your steam library 
and hit `Properties > Browse Local Files`.

## Uninstall

Removed the Uninstall folder for now. The best way to do this would probably be
to remove the Data and Survival folders and verify the files with Steam. I've also
gone about it by uninstalling the whole game and reinstalling. I'll probably add
the Uninstall folder back in sometime.

## Added Mods
Added a blue print tool for storing vehicles/creations and then can extract them
if the appropriate parts are in the new printer container. Original code by ren
